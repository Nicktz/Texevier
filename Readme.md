Introduction
============

This package helps a user set up an Elsevier template for writing
academic journal reports in Rmarkdown. The setup requires very few lines
of code and will get you up and running in *a few seconds* (provided you
have all the relevent dependencies installed - see below), with a fully
working and good-to-go template.

Using Texevier you can simply start writing your paper / thesis / phd in
R, with a template guiding you through the most important aspects you
will encounter in your writing. Your template will look as follows:

Dependencies Required
---------------------

Make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

-   [R](http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/)
-   [Rstudio](http://www.rstudio.com/)
-   [tinytex](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) by running:

``` r
install.packages(c('tinytex', 'rmarkdown'))
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

Alternatively, you could install the full
[MikTex](http://miktex.org/download) version.

Code
----

After installing all three at the top, simply run the following code
**(NOTE - if you experience issue when installing, set ShowPDFatLaunch
to FALSE and investigate the Rmd file directly.)**:

    if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
    library(devtools)
    devtools::install_github("Nicktz/Texevier")
    library(Texevier)
    # Input your directory as dir:
    dir <- "YOUR DIRECTORY HERE"
    create_template(directory = dir, template_name = "Template", ShowPDFatLaunch = TRUE)

This will automatically install all the needed files and components, and
allow you to start working with an Elsevier template in less than a
minute. A pdf will pop up, if you keep ShowPDFatLaunch = TRUE, which you
can scroll through to see what your template looks like. REMEMBER to
close the pdf before attempting to edit the template. Conversely, set
ShowPDFatLaunch = FALSE. By default your template R files will be
launched.

A template.Rmd file will also be opened automatically from the directory
provided, which contains all the needed notes on how to write an
academic paper in R to produce the pdf example shown. I recommend going
through the code in depth for a good reference before you start working.
Also, start your paper journey by creating a R.proj within your working
folder.

Motivation
----------

Doing research in R allows you to verify your work easily. This template
is designed to save the researcher time in terms of setting up a proper
template for doing formal research. This is something which could feel
daunting and can be time-consuming for even intermediate LaTeX and R
users. This package is intended to get you started in less than a
minute.

Feel free to edit the templates and use this as a starting point for
your own research.
